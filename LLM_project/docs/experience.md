# Project Experience

## Overview
The **Data Analysis Agent API** automates data query processing using **FastAPI**, **LangChain**, and **Llama 3:8B**. It supports tasks like missing value detection, outlier analysis, transformations, visualization, and correlation analysis.

## Key Achievements
- **AI-Powered Query Processing**: Uses **LangChain** and **Ollama** for **context-aware** responses with multi-step reasoning.
- **Tool-Based Execution**: Implements structured tools for listing files, detecting missing values/outliers, statistical summaries, filtering, sorting, and visualization.
- **Optimized API Performance**: Built with **FastAPI** for low-latency responses, CORS support, and **asynchronous processing** using **Uvicorn**.
- **Robust Logging & Monitoring**: Uses **loguru** with multi-level logging and a **/health** endpoint.
- **Testing & Validation**: Includes a test suite for **data quality checks, correlation analysis, and outlier detection** to ensure accuracy.

## Challenges & Solutions
| Challenge | Solution |
|-----------|----------|
| Complex multi-step queries | Implemented structured reasoning and intermediate step tracking. |
| Execution speed | Used caching and optimized query pipelines. |
| Debugging issues | Integrated detailed logging for tool execution. |
| Scalability | Leveraged **FastAPI** with asynchronous processing. |

## Future Enhancements
- Upgrade to **Llama 3:70B** or **GPT-based models**.
- Integrate a **database** for query logs.
- Support **dynamic tool loading**.
- Enhance visualizations with **interactive charts (Plotly, Altair)**.

## Conclusion
The **Data Analysis Agent API** provides a seamless, AI-driven approach to **natural language data querying**. Its modular design ensures scalability and adaptability for evolving analytical needs.
